        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
            (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
            population of
            23.7 billion as of 2018.<sup><a href="somesource.com">[1]</a></sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2]
            There are more chickens in the world than
            any other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
            their
            meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
            chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).</p>

        <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5]
            but
            with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian
            subcontinent.
            From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th
            century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth
            every
            day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of
            Thutmose
            III.</p>

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas
                in
                the
                United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters. Males less
                than a
                year
                old are cockerels.[10] Castrated or neutered roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical
                castration
                are
                now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens, and younger females
                as
                pullets,[11] although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at
                16
                to
                20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook
                /tʃʊk/
                to describe all ages and both sexes.[12] The young are often called chicks.</p>

        <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Chickens are omnivores.[15] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even
            animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[16] or young mice.[17]</p>

        <h3>Behavior</h3>

        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
        <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
            eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking
            order",
            with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters
            from
            a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
            hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[20] When a rooster
            finds
            food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking
            up
            and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage
            them to eat.</p>
